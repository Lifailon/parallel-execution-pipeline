# Parallel SSH Pipeline over pussh

Parallel execution of commands on multiple hosts (not support parallel execution of commands on a single host and output coloring). This pipeline is a parameterized interface for the [pussh](https://github.com/bearstech/pussh) Bash script, so the `OpenSSH` must be installed on the Jenkins agent.
